# Game Closure Physics Demo

This is a very basic Physics demo using the Game Engine Game Closure and the Box2dWeb library.

The liquid particles only are rendered in a browser. There is not support for getImageData() method in mobile devices.

The metaball script is an adaptation of [this fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/julien/eCmpY/)
